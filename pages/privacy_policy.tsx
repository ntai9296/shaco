      <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>
        Information about your computer hardware and software may be
        automatically collected by Fireside LLC. This information can include:

      <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        The Fireside LLC website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
        online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
        disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
        deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
        cookie to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
        feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
        server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
        personalize Fireside LLC pages, or register with Fireside LLC site or
        services, a cookie helps Fireside LLC to recall your specific
        information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
        recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
        addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Fireside LLC website,
        the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
        easily use the Fireside LLC features that you customized.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the Fireside LLC services or websites you visit.

      </p>
      <ul>
